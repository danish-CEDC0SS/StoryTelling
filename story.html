            <h2>The <u><b class="ani1">null1</b></u> And The <u><b class="ani2">null2</b></u></h2>
            <p>A <u><b class="ani1">null3</b></u> was making fun of the <u><b class="ani2">null4</b></u> one day for being so slow.</p>
            <p><q>Do you ever get anywhere?</q> he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>
            <p><q><u><b id="ani10">null5</b></u></q>, replied the <u><b class="ani2">null6</b></u>, <q>but Iget there <u><b id="ani7">null7</b></u> than the think. I'll run you a race and prove it.</q></p>
            <p>The <u><b class="ani1">null8</b></u> was much <u><b id="ani4">null9</b></u> at the idea of running a race with the <u><b class="ani2">null10</b></u>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u><b id="ani3">null11</b></u>, who had consented to the act as judge, marked the distance yelled, <q><u><b id="ani8">null12</b></u></q>.</p>
            <p>The <u><b class="ani1">null13</b></u> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <u><b class="ani2">null14</b></u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <u><b class="ani1">null15</b></u>, he went off the course to practice <u><b class="ani5">null16</b></u> for <u><b id="ani6">null17</b></u> hours untill the <u><b class="ani2">null18</b></u> should catch up.</p>
            <p>The <u><b class="ani2">null19</b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <u><b class="ani1">null20</b></u> was <u><b class="ani5">null21</b></u>. The <u><b class="ani1">null22</b></u> was so caught up in <u><b class="ani5">null23</b></u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u><b class="ani2">null24</b></u> was near the goal. The <u><b class="ani1">null25</b></u> now ran his siftest, but he could not overtake the <u><b class="ani2">null26</b></u> in time</p>
